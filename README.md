# Student Dataset Analysis

## Overview
This project involves the analysis of a dataset containing information about students. Various Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn were utilized for data manipulation, visualization, and analysis.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis contains information about students, including attributes such as age, gender, exam scores, study time, and more. The dataset is stored in a CSV (Comma Separated Values) file named `student_scores.csv`.

## Libraries Used
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- NumPy: For numerical computing.
- Matplotlib: For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.
- Seaborn: For statistical data visualization based on Matplotlib.

## Analysis Steps
1. **Data Loading**: Loaded the dataset from the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Checked for missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. Imputed missing values or dropped rows/columns as necessary.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducted exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the distribution and relationships between different variables in the dataset.
4. **Visualization**: Utilized Matplotlib and Seaborn to create visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, bar plots, etc., to visualize patterns and trends in the data.
5. **Statistical Analysis**: Performed statistical analysis to derive meaningful insights from the data, including summary statistics, correlations, hypothesis testing, etc.
6. **Conclusion**: Summarized the findings of the analysis, highlighting key insights and trends observed in the dataset.

## Files Included
- `student_scores.csv`: The dataset used for analysis.
- `analysis.ipynb` or `analysis.py`: Jupyter Notebook or Python script containing the code for data analysis.
- `README.md` (this file): Overview of the project, dataset, analysis steps, and files included.
