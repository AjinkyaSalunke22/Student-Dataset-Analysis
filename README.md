Student Dataset Analysis
Overview
This project involves the analysis of a dataset containing information about students. Various Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn were utilized for data manipulation, visualization, and analysis.

Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis contains information about students, including attributes such as age, gender, exam scores, study time, and more. The dataset is stored in a CSV (Comma Separated Values) file named student_scores.csv.

Libraries Used
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical computing.
Matplotlib: For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.
Seaborn: For statistical data visualization based on Matplotlib.
Analysis Steps
Data Loading: Loaded the dataset from the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.
Data Cleaning: Checked for missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. Imputed missing values or dropped rows/columns as necessary.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the distribution and relationships between different variables in the dataset.
Visualization: Utilized Matplotlib and Seaborn to create visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, bar plots, etc., to visualize patterns and trends in the data.
Statistical Analysis: Performed statistical analysis to derive meaningful insights from the data, including summary statistics, correlations, hypothesis testing, etc.
Conclusion: Summarized the findings of the analysis, highlighting key insights and trends observed in the dataset.
Files Included
student_data.csv: The dataset used for analysis.
analysis.ipynb or analysis.py: Jupyter Notebook or Python script containing the code for data analysis.
README.md (this file): Overview of the project, dataset, analysis steps, and files included.
